Dear Sirs:

It is found that there are high active sessions (above 45) in EBS database. This may be due to long running
queries / programs or connections to database not getting terminated gracefully.

Kindly request users not to submit same job simultaneously in case system is slow and avoid concurrency.

This is a system generated email.
